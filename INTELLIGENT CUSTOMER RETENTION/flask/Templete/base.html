<h1>TELECOM CUSTOMER CHUN PREDICTION</h1>
<p>Customer churn has become highly important for companies because of increasing competition among companies, increased importance of marketing strategies and conscious behaviour of customers in the recent years. Customers can easily trend toward alternative services. Companies must develop various strategies to prevent these possible trends, depending on the services they provide. During the estimation of possible churns, data from the previous churns might be used. An efficient chum predictive model benefits companies in many ways. Early identification of customers likely to leave may help to build cost effective ways in marketing strategies. Customer retention campaigns might be limited to selected customers but it should cover most of the customer. Incorrect predictions could result in a company losing profits because of the discounts offered to continuous subscribers.</p>
